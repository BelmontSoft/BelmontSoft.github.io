<h3>I'm Jeremiah Belmont, a programmer from Ohio. </h3>

<p>I decided that I wanted to study coding when I was playing around with building an HTML page ages ago; seeing my code manifest into something practical before my very eyes
sincerely felt like magic. Since then I've successfully obtained a B.S. in Computer Science, interned as an applications dev at one of America's leading tire manufacturers, and
published my own Android apps on Google Play for anyone to enjoy. Everyone knows that a good programmer is a lifelong student, and I'm always striving to learn something new - 
coding or otherwise.</p>

<p>In October 2023 I wrapped up a two-year stay in Aomori, Japan, where I worked as an English teacher / conversation instructor. I believe that broadening one's horizons is
healthy for the mind and soul both, and I feel all the more capable from my travels.</p>

<p>I can be opinionated and competitive, but I also always aim to be considerate and tactful. 
Peculiar penchants of mine include noir-styled jazz, rainy days, and retro gaming memorabilia.</p>
