<h3>My automatic dog whistle, Unbarkable, is out now!</h3>

<p>I developed this app out of personal necessity; I love my corgi dearly, but as a breed trait they <b>love</b> to police and woof at everything possible. I don't typically mind such behavior, but she's interrupted work calls in the past and I knew I needed a more reliable solution than repeatedly bellowing "Tifa, hush" back to her. Nothing on the Play Store really satisfied what I wanted out of a bark-stopping app, so I simply wrote my own!</p>

<p>Please check it out if you think it'll ever come in handy. I can vouch that it works brilliantly on Tifa. <i style='font-size:24px' class='fas'>&#xf6d3;</i></p>
