<h3> Hush those dog barks safely and easily. </h3>

<div>
  <p>
    Do you ever struggle to keep your pooch quiet when you need to? Barking keeping your neighbors awake, interfering with important work calls, or scaring away the postal workers? Then look no further than <b>Unbarkable!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Unbarkable converts your smartphone into an automatic dog whistle, releasing an ultrasonic noise to help your furry companion know when you need them to stop barking â€” giving you back your peace and quiet when you need it.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>What makes Unbarkable different?</h3>
<div>
  <p>It's built with a "set it and forget it" design philosophy, running in the background with minimal input required from the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also offered for free with no strings attached; it was created to save users from headaches, not bombard them with ads or mine information out of them.
