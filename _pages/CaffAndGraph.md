<h3> The most advanced caffeine tracker in the world. </h3>

<div>
  <span class="caffengraphp">Whether you're trying to limit your caffeine intake or you're studying how a macchiato affects your day, <b>Caff & Graph</b> is the tracker for you!
  More than a caffeine diary, Caff & Graph has been carefully designed with 3 principles in mind:</span>
  <ul class="caffengraphul">
    <li>Be informative.</li>
    <li>Be intuitive.</li>
    <li>Look good while doing it.</li>
  </ul>
  <span></span>
</div>

<h3>What makes Caff & Graph different?</h3>
<div>
  <p>There's other services out there that can calculate caffeine levels for you, but Caff & Graph goes a step further. 
    In addition to tracking standard caffeine metabolism, it also utilizes scientific averages to estimate
    how long it will take the caffeine to reach its peak in your blood, 
    when the effects of your body's accumulated caffeine will dip under the threshold where it's no longer "felt", and when the median time was between opening and finishing your drink.
    It then compiles all of these values into a straightforward, easy-to-read chart.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other unique features include a list of hundreds of different pre-loaded drinks to log your intake from, a caffeine calculator
    to help users with registering their own beverages, and a feed of fun facts centered around your personal intake statistics.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, all of this is offered to users for free; no data is scavanged and resold, and app use isn't broken up by intrusive ads.
